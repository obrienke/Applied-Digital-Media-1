 Prompt user to enter a number. Check the number entered is 20 or less. If it is, then print out to the web page the statement "Assessment 2" as many times as the number entered at the prompt. For example, if the user enters 2 at the prompt, then Assessment 2 is printed to the screen twice. See figure 1 below for example.
